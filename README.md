Visualizing Spotify Song Data

Introduction
This data visualization project aims to explore and analyze a Spotify song dataset using various univariate and multivariate graphs. The project utilizes the seaborn and matplotlib libraries in Python for data visualization.
Project overview
Univariate Graphs:
Definition: Univariate graphs represent data involving a single variable. They help us understand the distribution, central tendency, and spread of values within that variable.
Graphs Used in my Project:
1.	Histogram of Danceability Percentages:
•	Purpose: Shows how danceability percentages are spread across songs.
•	Insight: Reveals the variety in danceability within the dataset.
2.	Line plot of Energy Percentages in Spotify Charts:
•	Purpose: Illustrates the distribution of energy percentages for songs in Spotify Charts.
•	Insight: Highlights the range of energy levels among popular songs.
Bivariate Graphs:
Definition: Bivariate graphs involve the relationship between two variables. They help us understand how one variable changes with respect to another.
Graphs Used in my Project:
1.	Joint Plot with Regression Line (Energy vs Valence):
•	Purpose: Shows the relationship between energy and valence percentages.
•	Insight: Indicates if there's a trend or correlation between energy and valence.
2.	Hexbin Plot of Danceability vs Energy:
•	Purpose: Demonstrates how danceability and energy percentages are correlated.
•	Insight: Reveals patterns in the joint distribution of danceability and energy.
Multivariate Graphs:
Definition: Multivariate graphs involve more than two variables. They help us understand relationships and patterns among multiple variables simultaneously.
Graphs Used in my Project:
1.	Correlation Heatmap of BPM, Acousticness, and Speechiness Across Modes:
•	Purpose: Illustrates correlations among BPM, Acousticness, Speechiness, and the musical mode.
•	Insight: Shows how these features relate to each other across different musical modes.
2.	Bubble Plot of BPM, Acousticness, and Speechiness with Energy as the Bubble Size:
•	Purpose: Visualizes the relationship between BPM, Acousticness, Speechiness, and Energy.
•	Insight: Highlights the interplay of musical features, with bubble size indicating energy levels.
These graphs collectively help us to explore and communicate insights about the Spotify song dataset from different perspectives, making this analysis comprehensive and engaging.
